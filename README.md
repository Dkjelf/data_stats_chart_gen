# data_stats_chart_gen

These files generate a google graph based on a json file. This file is in another github repo.   
The critical line of code in the webpage is adding:  
< iframe src="http://rawgit.com/Dkjelf/data_stats_chart_gen/master/ [CHARTNAME HERE].html" seamless width ="980" height = "275" scrolling= "no"> </iframe></p>    


Add this to each of the block segments or anywhere you want the graph.  
The chartname is the filename in this repo.
